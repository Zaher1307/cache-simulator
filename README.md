# Cache Simulator


## Description
- A program that simulates the behavior of cache memory system.
- It's a part of the 4th lab of [15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15213-f15/www/schedule.html).
- The simulator in [cache-sim.c](https://github.com/Eslam-Walid/cache-simulator/blob/main/cache-sim.c) takes memory trace generated by [valgrind](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/valgrind.1.html) as input, simulates and counts the (hit, miss, evict) behavior of the cache and outputs the total number of (hits, misses and evictions).
- It can simulate the behavior of cache memory with arbitrary size and associativity selected by the user.
- The program is partitioned into three sections: (1): **parse** the command-line options. (2) **allocate** memory for the cache and **initialize** it. (3): **simulate** each memory access in the trace file the print the output.


## How to test it?
Run the following commands to get it on your local machine:
- `git clone https://github.com/Zaher1307/cache-simulator.git`.
- `make`.

Use the following command to print a help message of how to use it:

- `./csim -h`.
